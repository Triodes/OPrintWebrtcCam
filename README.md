# OPrintWebrtcCam
Android app to turn you phone into an OctoPrint compatible WebRTC camera

This app is completely experimental and by no means stable.

### TODO:
* [ ] Fix sdp error reported by Crys
* [ ] Allow multiple connections to be made
* [ ] Correctly rotate snapshots

### Other things I would like:
* [ ] No cropping of preview (i.e. letterbox)
* [ ] Focus control
* [ ] Exposure control
* [ ] Convert src to Kotlin
